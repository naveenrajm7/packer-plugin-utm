- `boot_steps` ([][]string) - This is an array of tuples of boot commands, to type when the virtual
  machine is booted. The first element of the tuple is the actual boot
  command. The second element of the tuple, which is optional, is a
  description of what the boot command does. This is intended to be used for
  interactive installers that requires many commands to complete the
  installation. Both the command and the description will be printed when
  logging is enabled. When debug mode is enabled Packer will pause after
  typing each boot command. This will make it easier to follow along the
  installation process and make sure the Packer and the installer are in
  sync. `boot_steps` and `boot_commands` are mutually exclusive.
  
  Example:
  
  In HCL:
  ```hcl
  boot_steps = [
    ["1<enter><wait5>", "Install NetBSD"],
    ["a<enter><wait5>", "Installation messages in English"],
    ["a<enter><wait5>", "Keyboard type: unchanged"],
  
    ["a<enter><wait5>", "Install NetBSD to hard disk"],
    ["b<enter><wait5>", "Yes"]
  ]
  ```
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "boot_steps": [
      ["1<enter><wait5>", "Install NetBSD"],
      ["a<enter><wait5>", "Installation messages in English"],
      ["a<enter><wait5>", "Keyboard type: unchanged"],
  
      ["a<enter><wait5>", "Install NetBSD to hard disk"],
      ["b<enter><wait5>", "Yes"]
    ]
  }
  ```

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create for the VM. By
  default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep the VM registered with
  UTM. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will not export the VM. Useful
  if the build output is not the resultant image, but created inside the
  VM.

- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address that should be
  binded to for VNC. By default packer will use 127.0.0.1 for this. If you
  wish to bind to all interfaces use 0.0.0.0.

- `vnc_use_password` (bool) - Whether or not to set a password on the VNC server. This option
  automatically enables the QMP socket. See `qmp_socket_path`. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum and maximum port
  to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. The builder uses VNC to type
  the initial boot_command. Because Packer generally runs in parallel,
  Packer uses a randomly chosen port in this range that appears available. By
  default this is 5900 to 6000. The minimum and maximum ports are inclusive.
  The minimum port cannot be set below 5900 due to a quirk in how QEMU parses
  vnc display address.

- `vnc_port_max` (int) - VNC Port Max

- `vm_arch` (string) - QEMU system architecture of the virtual machine.
  If this is a QEMU virtual machine, you must specify the architecture
  Which is required in confirguration. By default, this is aarch64.

- `vm_backend` (string) - Backend to use for the virtual machine.
  apple : Apple Virtualization.framework backend.
  qemu : QEMU backend.
  By default, this is qemu.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the utm file for the new virtual machine, without
  the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where
  "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
